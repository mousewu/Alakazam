title: More About Indoor Localization
---

We just found there are several userful sensor-based algorithm that could potentially enhance the accuracy of indoor localization. One of which called HDE (Heuristic Drift Elimination), the code is written in Java and public avaliable online. I will try to implement those code into our sensor collection procedure. Another one is called PSP, the code is not avaliable, I will contact the author and see if I can have their code.
