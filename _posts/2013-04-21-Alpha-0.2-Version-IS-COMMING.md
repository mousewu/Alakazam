title: Alpha 0.2 Version is comming!
---

Final is comming… Alpha 0.2 provides several features:

	1. GPS Data Posting (Using Baidu SDK)
	2. Indoor Wifi BSSID based Localization
	3. Indoor Sensor based Step counter

Now, we are working on the accelerometer. Step-count is one popular kind of apps (You can search *pedometer, Android* ). A lot of source code is avaliable online. However, in our project, we need to know the exact user current state (e.g. walking, running, standing, in an elevator…), and all these online codes does not provide those features. I think we need re-write part of those code and define a concept called *mean accelerate*.
